### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer at Quansight, working on NumPy and other open source projects. I care deeply about teaching, mentoring, and have been involved in the Python community for some time. You can find most of my talk slides here on github; feel free to use those according to the licenses stated in each repo.
